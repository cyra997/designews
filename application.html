        <p>The application is designed for blind and visually impaired people
           to take their own photos, edit them and then upload it to their
           social media accounts. The app speaks to the user and describes
            what is on the screen. Depending on what the user wants to do,
             they can tap on the correct part of the screen which will take
             them to the next step.
           The user will have their picture uploaded to their chosen account.</p>
